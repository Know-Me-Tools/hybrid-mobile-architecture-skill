## Session Metadata

- **Phase:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Project:** Hybrid Mobile Architecture
- **Repository root:** `/Users/gqadonis/Projects/hybrid-mobile-architecture-src`
- **Executor status:** session complete
- **Recorded change:** unknown

## Context

This executor run completed during the `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification` phase. The phase is part of the broader effort documented in [Hybrid Mobile Architecture PoC Phase Goals and Current Status](/hybrid-mobile-architecture-poc-phase-goals-and-current-status.md) and follows the implementation context captured in [Hybrid Mobile PoC Codegen and CI Verification Session](/hybrid-mobile-poc-codegen-and-ci-verification-session.md).

## Relevant Phase Objective

The phase objective had been revised from pipeline verification alone to delivering a working proof-of-concept application under:

```text
apps/<name>/
```

The PoC is expected to use repository scaffolds and skill packages, guided by KnowMe reference documentation in:

```text
docs/reference-app/
```

Reference inputs include:

- Functional specification
- Moodboard
- User journeys

## Required PoC Capability Coverage

The completed executor session relates to a PoC expected to demonstrate end-to-end skill package behavior across:

- Streaming `ContentBlock` chat
- PEM entity management
- SurrealDB graph-RAG memory
- Local-first sync
- Cross-platform delivery from one Rust core:
  - Flutter mobile
  - Tauri desktop
  - Web

## Observed Runtime State

At the captured phase context, the Tauri development app was running and visible in a native window titled:

```text
knowme-poc
```
