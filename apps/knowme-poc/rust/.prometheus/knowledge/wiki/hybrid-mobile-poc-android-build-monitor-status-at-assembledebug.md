## Context

- **Phase:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Project:** Hybrid Mobile Architecture
- **KBD root:** `~/Projects/hybrid-mobile-architecture-src`
- **Captured:** `2026-07-16T13:54:33Z`
- **Recorded status:** `executing`
- **Source context:** `manual:Hybrid Mobile Architecture/phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`

This status update continues the KnowMe proof-of-concept verification stream tracked in [Hybrid Mobile PoC Phase Codegen and CI Execution Context](/hybrid-mobile-poc-phase-codegen-and-ci-execution-context.md), [T8 Resume Status for Hybrid Mobile PoC Codegen Verification](/t8-resume-status-for-hybrid-mobile-poc-codegen-verification.md), [Hybrid Mobile PoC phase goals for codegen and CI verification](/hybrid-mobile-poc-phase-goals-for-codegen-and-ci-verification.md), and [Hybrid Mobile PoC Android build reached Gradle assembleDebug](/hybrid-mobile-poc-android-build-reached-gradle-assembledebug.md).

## Current status

- Position: `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- Status: `executing`
- No new error was recorded.
- The build has again reached Gradle's `assembleDebug` stage.

## Phase objective

As revised on `2026-07-15`, the phase deliverable is a working proof-of-concept application, not only pipeline verification. Code generation and CI checks remain supporting objectives that the PoC proves in passing.

The PoC must be built under:

```text
apps/<name>/
```

It must use this repository's scaffolds and skills, guided by KnowMe reference documentation in:

```text
docs/reference-app/
```

The PoC is expected to demonstrate the broadest practical range of supported capabilities:

- Streaming `ContentBlock` chat
- PEM entity management
- SurrealDB graph-RAG memory
- Local-first sync
- Cross-platform Flutter, Tauri, and web support from one Rust core
- A feature subset selected through web research into showcase-app best practices and 2026 on-device AI feasibility

## Supporting verification goals

The original codegen/CI phase goals remain required as evidence that the PoC works end-to-end:

- Run the real codegen pipeline on the PoC:
  - `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`
  - `dart run build_runner build`
  - full `flutter pub get`
  - full `pnpm install`
- Confirm pre-codegen warnings clear after generated code and sibling packages exist.
- Resolve or work around the PEM install blocker:

```text
@prometheus-ags/entity-graph-core@workspace:* unresolvable outside the PEM monorepo
```

- Verify the PoC builds and runs on at least one real target per surface:
  - macOS Tauri desktop
  - iOS simulator or Android emulator/device for Flutter
- Wire CI to run on every push:
  - `cargo clippy --workspace`
  - `audit.sh all`
  - boundary test suites against the PoC

## Immediate next step

Continue waiting on the Android build monitor through:

1. `whisper.cpp` CMake configure, now with `CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI` reaching the toolchain file.
2. Full RocksDB/Rust cross-compilation.
3. APK install.
4. App launch on `SM S936U`.
