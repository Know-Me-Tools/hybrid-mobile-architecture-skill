## Phase Metadata

- **Phase:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Project:** Hybrid Mobile Architecture
- **KBD worktree:** `/Users/gqadonis/Projects/hybrid-mobile-architecture-src/.claude/worktrees/gallant-blackburn-b9ccea`
- **Captured:** `2026-07-16T09:05:07Z`
- **Recorded status:** `executing`
- **Source context:** `manual:Hybrid Mobile Architecture/phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`

This update continues the broader [Hybrid Mobile Architecture PoC Phase Goals and Current Status](/hybrid-mobile-architecture-poc-phase-goals-and-current-status.md) effort and follows the execution context in [Hybrid Mobile PoC Phase Codegen and CI Execution Context](/hybrid-mobile-poc-phase-codegen-and-ci-execution-context.md).

## Revised Phase Goal

As of `2026-07-15`, the phase objective was revised: the end result must be a working proof-of-concept application, not only codegen and CI verification. Codegen and CI checks remain supporting objectives that the PoC must prove in passing.

The PoC must be built under:

```text
apps/<name>/
```

It must use repository scaffolds and skills, guided by KnowMe reference documentation in:

```text
docs/reference-app/
```

Reference inputs include:

- Functional specification
- Moodboard
- User journeys

## Required PoC Coverage

The PoC must demonstrate the skill package end-to-end and showcase the broadest practical set of supported capabilities:

- Streaming `ContentBlock` chat
- PEM entity management
- SurrealDB graph-RAG memory
- Local-first sync
- Cross-platform delivery from one Rust core:
  - Flutter mobile
  - Tauri desktop
  - Web

Feature subset selection should be informed by web research on showcase-app best practices and 2026 on-device AI feasibility.

## Supporting Verification Goals

The original codegen/CI goals remain required as supporting proof points:

- Run the real codegen pipeline on the PoC:
  - `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`
  - `dart run build_runner build`
  - Full `flutter pub get`
  - Full `pnpm install`
- Confirm pre-codegen warnings clear once generated code and sibling packages exist.
- Resolve or work around the PEM install blocker:

```text
@prometheus-ags/entity-graph-core@workspace:*
```

- Verify the PoC builds and runs on at least one real target per surface:
  - macOS Tauri desktop
  - iOS simulator or Android emulator for Flutter
- Wire CI to run on every push:
  - `cargo clippy --workspace`
  - `audit.sh all`
  - Boundary test suites against the PoC

## Current Session Status

- T6 and T7 remain complete and committed.
- T8 was interrupted mid-flight but preserved meaningful progress in its isolated worktree.
- T8 has been resumed instead of restarted to avoid discarding working state.
- Flutter FFI codegen appears to have succeeded in this checkout for the first time.
- Generated bindings and Flutter codegen output already exist in the resumed T8 worktree.
- The resumed T8 agent is running in the background; next action is to wait for its completion notification rather than polling.

## Planned Verification Before Merge

After T8 reports completion, perform independent validation before merging, matching the review approach used for T6/T7:

```bash
flutter analyze
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Also review the race-condition fix included in T8 output.

## Next Steps

1. Wait for resumed T8 agent completion report.
2. Independently verify Flutter and TypeScript analysis.
3. Review the race-condition fix.
4. Merge T8 only after verification.
5. Proceed to T9.
6. Check in with the user before T10/T11.
