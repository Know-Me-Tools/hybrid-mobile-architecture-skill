## Context

- **Phase:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Project:** Hybrid Mobile Architecture
- **KBD root:** `~/Projects/hybrid-mobile-architecture-src`
- **Captured:** `2026-07-16T12:29:40Z`
- **Recorded status:** `executing`

This update continues the Hybrid Mobile Architecture proof-of-concept verification tracked in [T8 Resume Status for Hybrid Mobile PoC Codegen Verification](/t8-resume-status-for-hybrid-mobile-poc-codegen-verification.md), [Hybrid Mobile PoC Phase Codegen and CI Execution Context](/hybrid-mobile-poc-phase-codegen-and-ci-execution-context.md), and [Hybrid Mobile PoC phase goals and verification scope](/hybrid-mobile-poc-phase-goals-and-verification-scope.md).

## Revised phase objective

As of `2026-07-15`, the phase deliverable is a working proof-of-concept application, not only code generation and CI verification. The original codegen/CI goals remain supporting objectives that the PoC must prove in passing.

The PoC must be built under:

```text
apps/<name>/
```

It must use repository scaffolds and skills and be guided by KnowMe reference documentation in:

```text
docs/reference-app/
```

Required proof points include:

- Streaming `ContentBlock` chat.
- PEM entity management.
- SurrealDB graph-RAG memory.
- Local-first sync.
- Cross-platform Flutter, Tauri, and web delivery from one Rust core.
- A selected feature subset informed by showcase-app best practices and 2026 on-device AI feasibility.

## Supporting verification goals

The PoC must verify the original pipeline and CI scope:

- Run the real codegen pipeline against the PoC:
  - `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`
  - `dart run build_runner build`
  - Full `flutter pub get`
  - Full `pnpm install`
- Confirm pre-codegen warnings clear once generated code and sibling packages exist.
- Resolve or work around the PEM install blocker:

```text
@prometheus-ags/entity-graph-core@workspace:* unresolvable outside the PEM monorepo
```

- Verify that the PoC builds and runs on at least one real target per surface:
  - macOS Tauri desktop.
  - iOS simulator or Android emulator/device for Flutter.
- Wire CI to run on every push:
  - `cargo clippy --workspace`
  - `audit.sh all`
  - Boundary test suites against the PoC.

## Current execution status

The `ExecOperations` patch is confirmed working. `cargokit`'s `run_build_tool` is now executing as intended.

Observed Android build progress:

- Android Rust target installation has started/completed as part of the build tool execution.
- The build is proceeding to cross-compile `gen_ui_ffi` for:

```text
aarch64-linux-android
```

- This is expected to take several minutes on the first Rust cross-compile.
- No corrective action is currently required.

## Next action

Continue monitoring through:

1. Rust cross-compilation.
2. JNI packaging.
3. APK install.
4. App launch on device:

```text
SM S936U
```

If the launch fails, diagnose from the next error point; otherwise confirm Android target success for the Flutter surface.
