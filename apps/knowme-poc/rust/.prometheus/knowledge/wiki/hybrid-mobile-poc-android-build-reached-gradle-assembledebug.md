## Context

- **Phase:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Project:** Hybrid Mobile Architecture
- **KBD root:** `~/Projects/hybrid-mobile-architecture-src`
- **Captured:** `2026-07-16T13:37:26Z`
- **Recorded status:** `executing`
- **Source context:** `manual:Hybrid Mobile Architecture/phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`

This update continues the Hybrid Mobile Architecture KnowMe PoC verification tracked in [T8 Resume Status for Hybrid Mobile PoC Codegen Verification](/t8-resume-status-for-hybrid-mobile-poc-codegen-verification.md), [Hybrid Mobile PoC Phase Codegen and CI Execution Context](/hybrid-mobile-poc-phase-codegen-and-ci-execution-context.md), [Hybrid Mobile PoC phase goals for codegen and CI verification](/hybrid-mobile-poc-phase-goals-for-codegen-and-ci-verification.md), and [Android Rust cross-compile progress for Hybrid Mobile PoC](/android-rust-cross-compile-progress-for-hybrid-mobile-poc.md).

## Revised phase objective

As of `2026-07-15`, the phase deliverable is a working proof-of-concept application, not only pipeline verification. Code generation and CI checks remain supporting objectives that the PoC must prove in passing.

The PoC must be implemented under:

```text
apps/<name>/
```

It must use repository scaffolds and skills, guided by KnowMe reference documentation in:

```text
docs/reference-app/
```

Reference inputs include the functional spec, moodboard, and user journeys.

## Required PoC proof points

The application should demonstrate the broadest practical range of supported capabilities:

- Streaming `ContentBlock` chat.
- PEM entity management.
- SurrealDB graph-RAG memory.
- Local-first sync.
- Cross-platform Flutter, Tauri, and web surfaces from one Rust core.
- Feature subset selected through web research on showcase-app best practices and 2026 on-device AI feasibility.

## Supporting verification goals

The original codegen/CI goals remain in scope and should be proven through the PoC:

- Run the real codegen pipeline:
  - `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`
  - `dart run build_runner build`
  - full `flutter pub get`
  - full `pnpm install`
- Confirm pre-codegen warnings clear after generated code and sibling packages exist.
- Resolve or work around the PEM install blocker:
  - `@prometheus-ags/entity-graph-core@workspace:*` is unresolvable outside the PEM monorepo.
- Verify the PoC builds and runs on at least one real target per surface:
  - macOS Tauri desktop.
  - iOS simulator or Android emulator/device for Flutter.
- Wire CI to run on every push:
  - `cargo clippy --workspace`
  - `audit.sh all`
  - boundary test suites against the PoC.

## Current execution status

- Position: `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- Status: `executing`
- The Android build has reached Gradle `assembleDebug`.
- No intervention is currently required.

## Next action

Continue waiting on the monitor through:

1. Native Rust cross-compilation.
   - Expected to be cached/fast because there were no source changes.
2. Dart compilation.
3. APK installation.
4. App launch on device `SM S936U`.

After launch, confirm success or diagnose the next surfaced issue.
