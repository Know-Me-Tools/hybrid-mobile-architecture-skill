// TJ-ARCH-MOB-001 compliant
//! Local-first sync engine (C-005 seams; C-106 FRF substrate).
//!
//! **Substrate: flint-realtime-fabric (FRF). ElectricSQL was dropped 2026-07-16** — FRF
//! reads `pgoutput` off its own replication slot, i.e. the same Postgres mechanism
//! Electric consumes, so the two are alternatives, not layers. See `sync/README.md` for
//! the full picture and the per-platform status.
//!
//! Read path (desktop): CDC → Iggy spine channel → [`FrfSyncTransport`] → [`LocalStore`].
//! Write path (all native): local mutation → **write queue** (idempotent keys,
//! exponential backoff, poison handler) → [`WriteSink`] → forge/Quarry → Postgres, which
//! the WAL picks up and fans back out. Writes deliberately do NOT go to the spine: it
//! persists nothing, so they would fan out once and then vanish.
//!
//! A [`SyncStatus`] broadcast drives the UI sync chip.
//!
//! [`SyncEngine`] is the **legacy Electric lane**, superseded by [`FrfSyncTransport`].
//!
//! Mobile's read lane is NOT wired: it has no Postgres (embedded SurrealDB is both config
//! and memory backend there), so [`PgLocalStore`] cannot serve it — see README/C-106 T5.
//!
//! Web path: this module compiles to a documented no-op on `wasm32` (tonic/HTTP-2 does
//! not build for the browser) so the workspace still builds for the browser leaf.
//!
//! Everything sits behind the frozen [`gen_ui_types::sync::SyncTransport`] seam, so
//! PES (PSyncV1) can replace the engine later without touching callers.
