// TJ-ARCH-MOB-001 compliant
//! DIY write queue: durable local action log replayed through a [`WriteSink`]
//! (forge Quarry API) with idempotent keys, exponential backoff, and a poison
//! handler. Read-path is Electric; this is the write-path half of local-first.
//!
//! The in-memory queue here is the replay engine; durability (survive restart) is
//! delegated to the same [`LocalStore`]-backed action-log table C-003 owns — this
//! module keeps the seam so persistence wires in without changing the replay logic.
