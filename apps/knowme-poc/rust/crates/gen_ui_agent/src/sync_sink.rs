// TJ-ARCH-MOB-001 compliant
//! [`WriteSink`] over the forge/Quarry data plane (C-106 T3c) — the write half of
//! local-first sync.
//!
//! **Why this lives in gen_ui_agent (L3) and not in gen_ui_db (L2):** the `WriteSink`
//! trait is declared in `gen_ui_db::sync`, and the client that satisfies it is
//! `gen_ui_client::flint::forge`. Those two are L2 siblings — neither depends on the
//! other, and making one do so would put a cycle in the layer graph. L3 is the first
//! layer that legitimately sees both, so the wiring belongs here. That is exactly what
//! the seam's own doc comment anticipated ("C-006's forge client implements this").
//!
//! **Why forge and NOT the FRF spine** (verified against FRF @ 9ba04ae, 2026-07-16):
//! `SpineService::Publish` writes to the Iggy broker only — there is no spine→Postgres
//! writer anywhere in the FRF workspace — and `EntityService` is read-only
//! (`GetEntity`/`WatchEntity`). CDC is therefore strictly **Postgres → spine**. A write
//! published to the spine would fan out to live subscribers and then vanish: it never
//! lands in Postgres, so it is absent from the next re-materialisation and never reaches
//! a device that was offline. That failure mode looks like a working demo and silently
//! loses data. Writes go to Postgres through Quarry's PostgREST surface; CDC picks them
//! up from the WAL and fans them back out. That is what closes the loop.
