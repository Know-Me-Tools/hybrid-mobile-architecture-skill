// TJ-ARCH-MOB-001 compliant
//! frb codegen root. Intent-level functions only (no raw SurrealQL / SQL across
//! the bridge). init + submodules for streams and CRUD.
//!
//! `streams`'s `StreamSink<T>` signatures reference the per-crate `StreamSink`
//! type that `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` emits into
//! `frb_generated.rs` — this crate is unbuildable before the first codegen run
//! (see references/rust/new-block-type.md's codegen-first-run note). Codegen
//! itself must run with `--rust-features frb-streams` gone (removed entirely,
//! 2026-07: the module is no longer feature-gated) so it actually sees these
//! functions and generates their SseEncode impls + Dart stream bindings —
//! there is no build of this crate, gated or not, that doesn't need them.
