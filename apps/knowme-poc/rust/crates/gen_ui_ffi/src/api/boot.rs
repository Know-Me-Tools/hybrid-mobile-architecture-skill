/// needs a `LocalStore` over SurrealDB, and `gen_ui_db_graph`'s public surface is
/// intent-level by design ("INTENT-LEVEL, never raw SurrealQL" — lib.rs): it exposes
/// `memory_ingest`/`memory_search`/`graph_expand`, not row upserts. Writing a
/// `SurrealLocalStore` means adding a row-persistence surface to that crate, which is a
/// real design decision about its contract — not something to smuggle in under a sync
/// task. Tracked as C-106 T5; the honest state is "desktop syncs, mobile does not yet".
