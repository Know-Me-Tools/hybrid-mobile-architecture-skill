// TJ-ARCH-MOB-001 compliant
//! Rust->Dart event streams via frb `StreamSink<T>`. Dart consumes each as a
//! broadcast `Stream` behind a Riverpod `@riverpod` stream provider (remember:
//! FFI providers must opt out of Riverpod 3 auto-retry).
//!
//! Three feeds map to the three UI chrome elements:
//!   * A2uiEvent   -> chat transcript (ContentBlock folding)
//!   * ChangeEvent -> entity cache invalidation (ref.invalidate bridge)
//!   * SyncStatus  -> the sync status chip
//!
//! C-007 lands the sink plumbing; Wave-1 lanes push real events into these sinks
//! from the agent loop (C-006) and sync engine (C-005). Until then the streams
//! open and stay idle.
//!
//! `StreamSink<T>` is the per-crate type emitted by codegen into
//! `frb_generated.rs` and brought into crate-root scope; this module compiles
//! only with the `frb-streams` feature (enabled after codegen runs). The bare
//! unqualified `StreamSink` name is the idiomatic frb 2.x form (see the frb
//! README's streaming example).
//!
//! All three sinks carry JSON `String`, not the gen_ui_types enum directly:
//! frb only mirrors a struct/enum into a real Dart class when it appears in a
//! `pub fn` argument or return type; a `StreamSink<T>` type parameter alone
//! doesn't count; the enum is emitted as an opaque handle with zero
//! Dart-visible fields instead (see docs/reference-app codegen notes).
//! gen_ui_types must stay frb-agnostic (it also compiles to wasm for Tauri/
//! React), so the fix lives here: serialize to JSON in gen_ui_ffi, and let
//! Dart's own `fromJson` (already generated on the PEM mirror types) decode
//! it — same serde tag shape on both ends.
