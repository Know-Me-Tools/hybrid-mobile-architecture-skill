# Tauri / React UI Review Loop

A React/Tauri surface is not done until it has passed a screenshot-driven review at every
breakpoint in both themes. This catches overflow, layout jumps, contrast failures, and
template-generic output before it ships.

## The loop

1. **Run the app** and navigate to the surface (`pnpm tauri dev`, or the web dev server for
   the browser target).
2. **Capture screenshots** at **320, 768, 1024, 1440** px wide, in **both light and dark**
   themes. Use BrowserClaw (`screenshot`) or Playwright. That is 8 shots for a themed
   surface.
3. **Inspect each** against the checklist below.
4. **Fix and re-capture** only the shots that regressed. Do not declare done from a single
   viewport.

## Checklist (per shot)

- [ ] **No horizontal overflow.** The page body never scrolls sideways; wide content
      (tables, code, diagrams) scrolls inside its own `overflow-x:auto` container.
- [ ] **No layout shift** from streaming content or async data (reserve space; explicit
      image `width`/`height`).
- [ ] **Hierarchy through scale contrast**, not uniform emphasis.
- [ ] **Intentional rhythm** — spacing varies with meaning, not uniform padding everywhere.
- [ ] **Designed hover / focus / active states** on every interactive element.
- [ ] **Both themes look intentional** — dark isn't just inverted light (see
      [[hybrid-design-tokens]]).
- [ ] **Not a default template.** Fails if it reads as stock shadcn/Tailwind with no point
      of view (centered hero + gradient blob + generic CTA; uniform card grid; gray-on-white
      with one accent). See the design-quality bar below.
- [ ] **Motion is compositor-friendly** (opacity/transform/clip-path only).
- [ ] **Touch targets ≥ 44px** at the 320/768 widths.

## Design-quality bar

Every meaningful surface should demonstrate **at least four**: clear hierarchy via scale
contrast; intentional spacing rhythm; depth/layering (overlap, surfaces, shadow, motion);
typography with a real pairing; semantic (not decorative) color; designed interaction
states; editorial/bento composition where it fits; atmosphere/texture when apt; motion that
clarifies flow; data-viz treated as part of the design system.

## Layer-contract reminder (don't violate while fixing)

- Components import only hooks. No direct store imports, no `invoke()`/`listen()` in a
  component or hook — those live only in Zustand stores.
- Server/async data via TanStack Query; client/UI state via Zustand; shareable state (tab,
  filter, sort) in the URL.
