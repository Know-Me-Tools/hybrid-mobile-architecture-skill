## Context

- **Project:** Hybrid Mobile Architecture
- **Phase:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **KBD root:** `~/Projects/hybrid-mobile-architecture-src/.claude/worktrees/pensive-greider-2e206c`
- **Captured:** `2026-07-16T11:49:05Z`
- **Position:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Status:** `executing`
- **Branch:** `claude/pensive-greider-2e206c`
- **Commit:** `2266d9c`
- **Destination repo:** `Know-Me-Tools/hybrid-mobile-architecture-skill` public GitHub repository

This session continues the revised KnowMe PoC phase tracked in [Phase Codegen and CI Verification Session Status](/phase-codegen-and-ci-verification-session-status.md), following implementation and verification work including [KnowMe PoC Codegen and Tauri Verification C-102](/knowme-poc-codegen-and-tauri-verification-c-102.md), [KnowMe Tauri Dev Build Clean After Branding and Startup Fixes](/knowme-tauri-dev-build-clean-after-branding-and-startup-fixes.md), [KnowMe PoC wasm embed_blocking fix for gen_ui_db_graph](/knowme-poc-wasm-embed-blocking-fix-for-gen-ui-db-graph.md), and [KnowMe PoC Phase PR #1 Opened for T6-T12](/knowme-poc-phase-pr-1-opened-for-t6-t12.md).

## Revised phase goal

As revised on `2026-07-15`, the phase deliverable is a **working proof-of-concept application**, not only codegen and CI verification.

The PoC must be built under:

```text
apps/<name>/
```

It must use repository scaffolds and skills, and be based on KnowMe reference documentation in:

```text
docs/reference-app/
```

The PoC should prove the skill package end to end and showcase the broadest practical range of supported capabilities:

- Streaming `ContentBlock` chat
- PEM entity management
- SurrealDB graph-RAG memory
- Local-first sync
- Cross-platform Flutter, Tauri, and web clients from one Rust core
- Feature subset selected via web research on showcase-app best practices and 2026 on-device AI feasibility

## Supporting objectives

The original codegen and CI goals remain supporting objectives, to be proven through the PoC:

- Run the real codegen pipeline on the PoC:
  - `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`
  - `dart run build_runner build`
  - Full `flutter pub get`
  - Full `pnpm install`
- Confirm pre-codegen warnings clear after generated code and sibling packages exist.
- Resolve or work around the PEM install blocker:

```text
@prometheus-ags/entity-graph-core@workspace:*
```

- Verify the PoC builds and runs on at least one real target per surface:
  - macOS Tauri desktop
  - iOS simulator or Android emulator for Flutter
- Wire CI to run on every push:
  - `cargo clippy --workspace`
  - `audit.sh all`
  - Boundary test suites against the PoC

## Completed local work

- Added a standing authorization rule in both:
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
- The rule section is named **“Session logs: always commit”** and records authorization to always commit and push all `.prometheus/` session logs.
- The same rule was saved to persistent memory for future sessions.
- Created local commit `2266d9c` on branch `claude/pensive-greider-2e206c`.
- Commit contents include:
  - Session wiki files
  - The wasm `embed_blocking` fix write-up
  - `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` session-log rule updates
- Rebased the branch cleanly onto `origin/main`.
- Union-merged diverged append-only logs:
  - `.prometheus/.../events.jsonl`
  - Wiki `index.md`
  - Wiki `log.md`
- Verified no conflict markers remain after the rebase/merge.

## Blocker

`git push` was denied by the auto-mode permission classifier.

Reason:

- `.prometheus/` contains session-transcript data.
- The target repository, `Know-Me-Tools/hybrid-mobile-architecture-skill`, is public.
- The classifier requires explicit confirmation before publishing session logs to a public destination.

Important context: `main` already contains earlier `.prometheus` logs pushed by prior sessions, so this would not be the first publication of `.prometheus` logs to the public repository.

## Required next action

One of the following must happen before the branch can be pushed and a PR opened:

1. User pushes manually:

```bash
git -C .claude/worktrees/pensive-greider-2e206c push -u origin claude/pensive-greider-2e206c
```

2. User adds a Bash permission rule allowing `git push` for this repository, then asks the agent to retry.

After push succeeds:

1. Open a PR to `main`.
2. Resume phase step 3:

```text
/kbd-apply 2026-07-15-c103-chat-live-e2e
```
