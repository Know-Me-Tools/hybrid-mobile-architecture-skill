## Session Summary

- **Phase:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Execution status:** `executor session complete`
- **Change:** `unknown`
- **Source status note:** Phase context reports `execute_in_progress`, with the latest completed checkpoint merged and the execution loop stopped by user choice.

## Project Context

- **Project:** Hybrid Mobile Architecture
- **KBD root:** `/Users/gqadonis/Projects/hybrid-mobile-architecture-src`
- **Captured:** `2026-07-16T00:43:21Z`
- **Latest completed checkpoint:** C-102 merged
- **Commit:** `86e7d1d` pushed to `main`

The latest completed checkpoint corresponds to [KnowMe PoC Codegen and Tauri Verification C-102](/knowme-poc-codegen-and-tauri-verification-c-102.md).

## Revised Phase Goal

As of `2026-07-15`, the phase target changed from code generation and CI verification alone to delivering a **working proof-of-concept application**.

The PoC must be built under:

```text
apps/<name>/
```

It should use repository scaffolds and skills, and be based on KnowMe reference documentation under:

```text
docs/reference-app/
```

## Required PoC Capabilities

The proof-of-concept should validate the skill package end to end and showcase the broadest practical set of supported capabilities:

- Streaming `ContentBlock` chat
- PEM entity management
- SurrealDB graph-RAG memory
- Local-first sync
- Cross-platform Flutter, Tauri, and web clients from one Rust core
- Feature subset selected using web research on showcase-app practices and 2026 on-device AI feasibility

## Supporting Objectives

The original codegen and CI goals remain supporting objectives and should be proven through the PoC. The provided source truncates the list after `- Ru`, so no further objective details are recoverable from this document.
