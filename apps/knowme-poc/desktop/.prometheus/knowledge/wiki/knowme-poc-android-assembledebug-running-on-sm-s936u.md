## Context

- **Project:** Hybrid Mobile Architecture
- **Phase:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **KBD root:** `/Users/gqadonis/Projects/hybrid-mobile-architecture-src`
- **Captured:** `2026-07-16T13:47:01Z`
- **Source phase record:** `manual:Hybrid Mobile Architecture/phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Position:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Status:** `executing`

This session continues the revised KnowMe proof-of-concept phase tracked across [Phase Codegen and CI Verification Session Status](/phase-codegen-and-ci-verification-session-status.md), [KnowMe PoC Codegen and Tauri Verification C-102](/knowme-poc-codegen-and-tauri-verification-c-102.md), [KnowMe Tauri Dev Build Clean After Branding and Startup Fixes](/knowme-tauri-dev-build-clean-after-branding-and-startup-fixes.md), [KnowMe PoC wasm embed_blocking fix for gen_ui_db_graph](/knowme-poc-wasm-embed-blocking-fix-for-gen-ui-db-graph.md), and the later PR status in [KnowMe PoC Phase PR #1 Opened for T6-T12](/knowme-poc-phase-pr-1-opened-for-t6-t12.md).

## Revised Phase Goal

As of `2026-07-15`, the phase deliverable is a **working proof-of-concept application**, not only codegen and CI verification.

The PoC must be built under:

```text
apps/<name>/
```

It must use repository scaffolds and skills, and be based on KnowMe reference documentation under:

```text
docs/reference-app/
```

## Required PoC Capability Coverage

The app should prove the skill package end to end and showcase the broadest practical supported capabilities:

- Streaming `ContentBlock` chat
- PEM entity management
- SurrealDB graph-RAG memory
- Local-first sync
- Cross-platform clients from one Rust core:
  - Flutter
  - Tauri desktop
  - web
- Feature subset selected using web research on showcase-app best practices and 2026 on-device AI feasibility

## Supporting Verification Goals

The original codegen and CI objectives remain supporting goals, proven through the PoC:

- Run the real codegen pipeline on the PoC:
  - `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`
  - `dart run build_runner build`
  - full `flutter pub get`
  - full `pnpm install`
- Confirm pre-codegen warnings clear once generated code and sibling packages exist.
- Resolve or work around the PEM install blocker:

```text
@prometheus-ags/entity-graph-core@workspace:*
```

- Verify the PoC builds and runs on at least one real target per surface:
  - macOS Tauri desktop
  - iOS simulator or Android emulator/device for Flutter
- Wire CI to run on every push:
  - `cargo clippy --workspace`
  - `audit.sh all`
  - boundary test suites against the PoC

## Current Session Status

- `Gradle assembleDebug` has started.
- No intervention is currently needed.
- Execution remains in monitoring mode while the Android build proceeds.

## Next Monitoring Checkpoint

Continue waiting through:

1. Rust / `whisper.cpp` cross-compilation
2. Dart compilation
3. APK install
4. App launch on device `SM S936U`

After completion, either confirm successful launch or diagnose any new surfaced issue.
