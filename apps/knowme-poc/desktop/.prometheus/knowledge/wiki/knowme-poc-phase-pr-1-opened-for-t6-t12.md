## Context

- **Project:** Hybrid Mobile Architecture
- **Phase:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **KBD root:** `~/Projects/hybrid-mobile-architecture-src/.claude/worktrees/gallant-blackburn-b9ccea`
- **Captured:** `2026-07-16T11:27:29Z`
- **Phase source record:** `manual:Hybrid Mobile Architecture/phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Position:** `phase-codegen-and-ci-verification`
- **Status:** `executing`

This session continues the revised KnowMe PoC phase described in [Phase Codegen and CI Verification Session Status](/phase-codegen-and-ci-verification-session-status.md), after earlier implementation and verification work such as [KnowMe PoC Codegen and Tauri Verification C-102](/knowme-poc-codegen-and-tauri-verification-c-102.md), [KnowMe Tauri Dev Build Clean After Branding and Startup Fixes](/knowme-tauri-dev-build-clean-after-branding-and-startup-fixes.md), and [KnowMe PoC wasm embed_blocking fix for gen_ui_db_graph](/knowme-poc-wasm-embed-blocking-fix-for-gen-ui-db-graph.md).

## Phase Goal

As revised on `2026-07-15`, the phase deliverable is a **working proof-of-concept application**, not only pipeline verification.

The PoC must be built under:

```text
apps/<name>/
```

It must use the repository scaffolds and skills, and be based on KnowMe reference documentation under:

```text
docs/reference-app/
```

The PoC should prove the skill package end to end and showcase the broadest practical set of supported capabilities:

- Streaming `ContentBlock` chat
- PEM entity management
- SurrealDB graph-RAG memory
- Local-first sync
- Cross-platform Flutter, Tauri, and web clients from one Rust core
- Feature subset selected through web research on showcase-app best practices and 2026 on-device AI feasibility

## Supporting Objectives

The original codegen/CI goals remain supporting objectives, to be proven through the PoC:

- Run the real codegen pipeline on the PoC:
  - `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`
  - `dart run build_runner build`
  - full `flutter pub get`
  - full `pnpm install`
- Confirm pre-codegen warnings clear once generated code and sibling packages exist.
- Resolve or work around the PEM install blocker:

```text
@prometheus-ags/entity-graph-core@workspace:*
```

- Verify the PoC builds and runs on at least one real target per surface:
  - macOS Tauri desktop
  - iOS simulator or Android emulator for Flutter
- Wire CI to run on every push:
  - `cargo clippy --workspace`
  - `audit.sh all`
  - boundary test suites against the PoC

## Session Outcome

A pull request was created successfully:

- **PR:** https://github.com/Know-Me-Tools/hybrid-mobile-architecture-skill/pull/1
- **Branch pushed:** `claude/gallant-blackburn-b9ccea`
- **Target branch:** `main`
- **Commit coverage:** all 6 commits from T6 through T12

The PR is open and ready for review. No further action is pending unless PR description edits or additional implementation changes are requested.

## Working Tree Note

A warning reported `18 uncommitted changes`. These changes are `.prometheus` auto-tracking files that were intentionally left unstaged and do not affect the PR content.
