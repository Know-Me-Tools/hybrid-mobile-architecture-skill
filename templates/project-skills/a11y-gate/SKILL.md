# Accessibility Gate (WCAG 2.2 AA)

Accessibility is half of "done" on every UI surface. This gate is the cross-surface WCAG
2.2 AA checklist. A `PostToolUse` hook reminds you to run it after a UI edit — but the hook
only reminds; you run the checks.

## Cross-surface checklist (both React/Tauri and Flutter)

- [ ] **Contrast ≥ AA** — 4.5:1 body text, 3:1 large text / UI components / focus
      indicators, in BOTH themes. Tokens come from [[hybrid-design-tokens]]; verify the
      resolved pairs, not just the token names.
- [ ] **Every actionable element has an accessible name** and a visible label or
      tooltip — no icon-only buttons without a name.
- [ ] **Keyboard reachable and operable** — full flow with Tab/Shift-Tab/Enter/Escape;
      logical focus order; no keyboard trap; visible focus ring.
- [ ] **Images/media have alt/label** — decorative marked as such; informative described.
      (`image` [[content-block-ui]] blocks: `alt` is mandatory.)
- [ ] **Reduced motion honored** — respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (web) /
      `MediaQuery.disableAnimations` (Flutter); provide a non-motion path.
- [ ] **Live regions announce streaming** — streaming `text`/`thinking` and status changes
      on `toolUse`/`skill` are announced (aria-live / Flutter `liveRegion` Semantics),
      politely, without spamming.
- [ ] **Target size ≥ 24×24 CSS px** (AA 2.5.8), ≥ 44px recommended for primary touch.
- [ ] **Status not by color alone** — pair color with icon/text (tool status, sync chip).

## React / Tauri specifics

- Use semantic HTML first (`<header>`/`<nav>`/`<main>`/`<button>`), ARIA only to fill gaps.
- Run an automated pass (axe via BrowserClaw/Playwright) at review time — see
  [[tauri-ui-review]] — but never treat automated pass as sufficient; do the keyboard walk.

## Flutter specifics

- Wrap meaningful widgets in `Semantics` with `label`/`hint`/`button`/`liveRegion`.
- Verify with the accessibility inspector; add a11y assertions to goldens where practical —
  see [[flutter-golden-ui]].
- Respect `MediaQuery.textScalerOf(context)` — layouts must not overflow at large text.

## The hook

The scaffolded project installs a `PostToolUse` hook (matcher: `Write|Edit`) that, when a UI
file is touched (`.tsx`/`.jsx` under `src/`, `.dart` under `lib/`), prints a reminder to run
this gate. It is advisory (non-blocking) — it does not judge the code, it ensures the gate
isn't silently skipped.
